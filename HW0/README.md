# CS 182: Artificial Intelligence
# Homework 0: Python Review

* Fall 2017
* Due: September 7th, 5pm


## Introduction
Welcome (back) to Python! The purpose of this warm-up assignment is to refresh your programming skills and help you recall some of the important concepts, such as:

* recursion vs. iteration,
* classes and instances,
* anonymous lambda functions,
* function mapping,
* destructive vs. nondestructive functions, and
* data structures

It is very important to complete this assignment on time because Python programming ability will be required for all subsequent assignments.


## Getting started

If you wish to start working on this assignment before the Python review session, go ahead and start planning out the code. Here are some resources you may find helpful:

[http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)

Complete the definitions of the required classes and functions by editing `util.py`. Alternatively, you can use any other editor and only use the command line to run the files. To test your code, add a main function to `util.py`, and add to it a call the method you want to test. The assignment file HW0.py can also be used to run tests directly: 

     > python HW0.py

See [http://ipython.org/](http://ipython.org/) for more details.

## Problems

Do all six problems. Unless otherwise noted, your functions should be non-destructive, meaning it should not change the object passed as arguments to functions. Always aim to make your programs elegant and include comments for all of your functions. Your solutions must adhere to the function specifications as they appear below. Your functions need not perform error checking, but must work for all reasonable input.


### Problem 1 (2 points)

Write a function called `matrix_multiply` which multiplies two 2-dimensional lists of real numbers. For instance,


```python
mm = util.matrix_multiply([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]) 
# should evaluate to
assert(mm == [[ 19, 22],[43, 50]])
```

Your function should return the result matrix as a 2-dimensional list

* *Note 1*: Your method should support general NxM matrices ("2-dimensional" above refers to the fact that they are matrices, not vectors or tensors).
* *Note 2*: You may assume that the dimensions of the input arrays are compatible.  
* *Note 3*: In real life you would use numpy or a similar library to handle matrix math, but for this exercise, please implement the method yourself. 

If you are not familiar with lists in Python, you may want to read about them here:

### Problem 2 (3 points)
Complete the definitions of the methods `init`, `push` and `pop` in the Python classes `MyQueue` and `MyStack`, using a deque data structure in Python. The operation pop should return, not print, the appropriate object in the structure. If empty, it should return None instead of throwing an error. On the other hand, operation push does not have to return anything. An example behavior is as follows:


```python
q = util.MyQueue()
q.push(1); q.push(2)
# should evaluate to
assert(q.pop() == 1)
```

If you are unfamiliar with deques and class declarations in Python, read about them here:

[http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.deque](http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.deque)

[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html)

### Problem 3 (3 points)
For the two classes written in Problem 2, override __eq__, __ne__, and __str__ methods. You can read about these methods in detail here:

[http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization)

Simply put, the above methods do the following:

* __eq__(self, other) returns True if self and other are `equal`.

* __ne__(self, other) returns True if self and other are `not equal`.

* __str__(self) returns a string representation of self. You may decide on whatever representation you want, but ideally the method should at least print the elements.

We will call two stacks or two queues _equal_ if and only if they contain the same elements and in the same order. You may assume that only elements they contain are integers.


### Problem 4 (5 points)
Write three functions called `add_position_iter`, `add_position_recur`, and `add_position_map`, using iteration, recursion, and the built-in map function, respectively. All the versions should take a list of numbers and return a new list containing, in order, each of the original numbers incremented by the position of that number in the list. Positions in lists are numbered starting with 0, so:


```python
ret = util.add_position_iter([7, 5, 1, 4])
assert(ret == [7, 6, 3, 7])
```

Remember that this function should not be destructive i.e.,


```python
a = [7, 5, 1, 4]
ret = util.add_position_iter(a)
assert(a != [7, 6, 3, 7])
```

Furthermore, your function should also take an optional argument `number_from`(default value = 0) that can be used to specify a different value from which to start numbering positions. In other words, instead of incrementing the first element by 0, the second by 1, etc., the function will increment the first element by the value of `number_from`, the second element by `number_from+1`,etc. For example:


```python
ret = util.add_position_iter([0, 0, 3, 1], number_from=3)
assert(ret == [3, 4, 8, 7])
```

### Problem 5 (4 points)

Write a function called `remove_course` which takes in `roster`, `student`, `course` as arguments and returns a modified roster. This function, unlike ones you've just written, should be destructive, meaning that roster should be modified directly.

* `roster` will be of type dictionary in Python. It will map a string (i.e., a student name) to a set. Each set will contain strings, representing courses the corresponding student is currently taking.
* `student` will be of type string; it will represent the name of the student.
* `course` will also be of type string.

You can read more about set and dict below:

[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

An example behavior is as follows:


```python
roster = {'kyu': set(['cs182']), 'david': set(['cs182'])}
util.remove_course(roster, 'kyu', 'cs182')
assert(roster == {'kyu': set([]), 'david': set(['cs182'])})
```

### Problem 6  (3 points)
Now write a function called `copy_remove_course`. The specifications are the same as above except the function should now be non-destructive. An example behavior is as follows:


```python
roster = {'kyu': set(['cs182']), 'david': set(['cs182'])}
new_roster = util.copy_remove_course(roster, 'kyu', 'cs182')
assert(roster == {'kyu': set(['cs182']), 'david': set(['cs182'])})
assert(new_roster == {'kyu': set([]), 'david': set(['cs182'])})

```

Hint: _copy_ the original roster and apply remove_course from Problem 5.

## Submission

The assignment should be completed individually. You are encouraged to consult online sources and post questions on Piazza. You are allowed, and encouraged to, discuss problems with your peers; however, you may not share code. Submit a link to your GitHub repository to Canvas by the due date. If you still have problems after consulting Python resources, you are encouraged to consult your peers, come to office hours, and use the Piazza discussion forum.

Good luck!
